## Sources for the [scribbles blog](https://i-bar.github.io/)

This project was generated (after a whole day of hard work) with [**hexo**](https://hexo.io/docs/).  

Hexo stores the **generated files** in [this repository](https://github.com/i-bar/i-bar.github.io).

The actual **blog posts** are the markdown (yay!) files in the [\_posts](https://github.com/i-bar/blog/tree/master/source/_posts) folder.

It is [**deployed**](https://hexo.io/docs/deployment) to the [github page](https://pages.github.com/) of this account.
